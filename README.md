# ProbUncertainty: Code and data associated with MS

Code associated with the manuscript titled "Classical tests, linear models, and their extensions for the analysis of 2x2 contingency tables". Currently under review at MEE.

The main source file is simulationCode.R, which can be used to run all of the manuscript simulations. The four .RData files share the simulated data used to generate the figures presented in the manuscript. The FiguresSummary.Rmd will generate all figures presented in the manuscript.
